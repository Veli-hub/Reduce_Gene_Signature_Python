# Reduce_Gene_Signature_Python
Python Functions to reduce a gene signature\
Info: During my internship at the Institute for Experimental Oncology at the Universit√§tsklinikum Bonn my task was asked to implement a way of reducing a gene signature that still has predictive power over patient outcome. There are several papers that found gene signatures that can be used to predict immunotherapy succes e.g.:
* Cancer Immunol Res July 1 2019 (7) (7) 1162-1174; DOI: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-18-0500: _A Gene Signature Predicting Natural Killer Cell Infiltration and Improved Survival in Melanoma Patients_
* Liao, M., Zeng, F., Li, Y. et al. A novel predictive model incorporating immune-related gene signatures for overall survival in melanoma patients. Sci Rep 10, 12462 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69330-2 \
We assume that a gene signature is given which has already predictive power so we can group patients by immune-hiigh and immune low groups so that we can compare the groups of patients to the grouping using a smaller gene signature.
