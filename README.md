# Reduce_Gene_Signature_Python
Python Functions to reduce a gene signature
Info: During my internship at the Institute for Experimental Oncology at the Universit√§tsklinikum Bonn I was asked to implement a way of reducing a gene signature that still has predictive power over patient outcome. 
We assume that a gene signature is given which has already predictive power so we can group patients by immune-hiigh and immune low groups so that we can compare the groups of patients to the grouping using a smaller gene signature.
